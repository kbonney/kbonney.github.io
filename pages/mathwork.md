- [Modular Curves](https://kbonney.github.io/modularcurves.pdf)
> The goal of this project is to develop a clear picture of how modular curves form moduli
spaces for elliptic curves with additional torsion data. Along the way, I hope to build a
’compendium’ of facts and perspectives for modular curves that can serve as a useful resource
for myself and others. 
- [Levi-Civita Connection](https://kbonney.github.io/leviaffine.pdf)
> The aim of this project is to investigate and understand the Levi-Civita connection. We
motivate this exploration in two ways. The first is by viewing the Levi-Civita as a necessary
component for the generalization of curvature to manifolds. The other will focus on a
simpler geometric concept - the straight line. We will demonstrate two different methods of
generalizing the straight line to manifolds; it will turn out that the Levi-Civita connection
is the natural way to reconcile these two points of view. Finally, we will end by stating the
Fundamental Theorem of Riemannian Geometry, the theorem guaranteeing the existence
and uniqueness of the Levi-Civita connection.
