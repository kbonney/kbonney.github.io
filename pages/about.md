### About me
My name is Kirk Bonney. I currently live in Fort Collins, Colorado where I am completing a masterâ€™s degree in Mathematics. I began my graduate program with
interests in number theory, particularly arithmetic geometry and automorphic forms. Over time, this developed into an interest in mathematical cryptography.
I am currently writing a master's paper exploring the large variety of NTRU cryptosystem variants that have been developed since the inception of NTRU in 1996.
While NTRU as originally conceived is a strong cryptosystem, the exploration of how various mathematical structures improve (or sometimes weaken) NTRU has given
the crypto community a stronger understanding of the power and limitations of NTRU as well as a robust selection of cryptosystems to implement.

AFter graduating, you will find me living in the Bronx where I am hoping to pursue a career in data science or cryptography. While I will always love pure
mathematics, I am excited to see how my mathematical training can help solve problems in these interesting industries.

Some of my non-technical hobbies include (but are certainly not limited to):
- music production (if you're interested in strange, experimental music, check out my [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/user-74781161))
- learning electric bass
- reading linguistics/sociology/anthropology themed books
- getting confused by French existential and po-mo philosophers
- hiking, running, playing frisbee golf, and occasionally having fun at bouldering gyms
