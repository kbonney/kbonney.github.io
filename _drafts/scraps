## The value of witholding details
The way we interact with a lot of media, and frankly our lives overall, sometimes has _too_ much context. Fantasy stories lay out the detail and nuances of their worlds in neat and tidy packages, video games provide structured boundaries of play and expectations; in life, there are online guides for just about every activity one can conceive of, which leaves little for us to discover on our own. I often reflect on a cooking memory where I was preparing chicken to go along some fried rice. At the same time, I was snacking on a mandarin orange, so in a moment of raw inspiration I decided to squeeze some of the juices from my snack onto the chicken. This resulted in some sort of delicious sweet and spicy glaze, giving me the best tasting chicken I have ever prepared. What tasted better was that it was the result of pure curiosity. The decision to roll into a wall rather follow the beaten path, unlocked a secret room and sweet victory.

Later in life, I did some reading on cooking techniques (shout out to Salt Fat Acid Heat) where I learned about the value and utility of acids in the kitchen. This helped me understand why what I did turned out so good. Had I learned this information prior to that fateful home-cooked meal -- letting the book be the driver of my decisions rather than experimentation -- the moment would not be nearly as special, and likely not one remembered years later.

I often feel an inner desire to follow the footsteps of the experts. To catch up. To use the best possible information to do the thing in the best possible way. A video from 

## Counterpoint
Is my point that we should always pursue activities blindly, avoiding any helpful knowledge in case it spoils some personal moment of discovery? No. What I am hoping to convey is the value of balancing the use of information in our life's pursuits. This pertains to personal experience, the "right" balance will depend on the individual, so I won't try to make any value judgements on how to find that balance. Though, I will offer one last anecdote to exemplify a way I am trying to find this balance for myself.

The day before writing this sentence was Christmas '22. Romana gifted to me a 35mm film camera. Having never touched analogue photography (outside of some instant film LINK TO INSTANT FILM PICTURES HERE), I immediately started googling articles and books to help prepare me for this experience. This is where I have to stop and think. How many details do I really want to lay out for myself? Am I trying to become a professional photographer here? Do I wish to fit in with the NYC art student scene? No. I am here to have fun and try things. So let's pull a couple film books off of my reading list, and focus on what is going to best empower me to "have fun and try things." For me, it is little fun to blow a roll of film on over and under exposed shots. I'd at least like for my photos to _come out_.

My wife (Romana) and I got interested in AoaB after watching a [deep dive on isekai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6fghPHF3Zc) by YouTuber Noralities.

Outline:

Main point: genuione experiences of discovery make media good
hook: combining two really different looking pieces of media to catch attention
example 1: AoaB
    intentional choices about the plot set up the protagonist (by extension, viewer) for more moments of genuine discovery
    concrete example of this happening
    broader comments on how this makes things more enjoyable
example 2: DS
    little explanation and lack of traditional limitations allow the player to really invest in discovery
wrap up:


Ambiguity
However, the game contains much more than the initally presented details. How one progresses and deals with the challenges ahead is left entirely up to the individual. This allows for many moments of discovery that are not explicitly scripted or planned by the developers, but are emergent from the unique circumstances of one's journey.
