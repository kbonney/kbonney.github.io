This is a tale of two pieces of media that happened to cross my paths at the same time: _Ascendence of a Bookworm_ (AooB) and _Dark Souls_ (DS), and the lessons that they teach us about life. For the unaquainted, the former is a sleeper hit of an [isekai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isekai) anime which subverts the genre by not being awful. The latter is the first entry from the delightfully difficult Dark Souls trilogy, which has brought enough ingenuity to the gaming landscape to spawn its own subgenre called _Souls-like_. Both are triumphs of their respective mediums, and one will find no shortage of praise for them. However, I have not gathered you here to simply explain why I think they are great. Rather, we are all here to understand:

> What on earth could a wholesome anime and a grimy RPG have in common?

We'll get there, I promise. 

## Ascendence of a Bookworm
Enter Urano: college student studying to become a librarian. Enter bookshelf: plot-driving furniture which ironically crushes previously introduced protagonist during an earthquake. A sad start to any story, but this is an isekai. This means that Urano will shortly be transported to another world. Urano awakens as a sickly peasant child named Main (pronounced mai-een).

Typically in an isekai anime, an author might be tempted to info-dump an entire world onto the newly incarnated protoganist. This is a pretty lame way to get a show started, but low hanging fruit sometimes tastes the sweetest (or helps to meet deadlines, at least). Learning about the world through this common trope expressly removes the joy from organically discovering facts and details about the brand new places, people, magic, and whatever else that might await. This sort of discovery is one of the few ways that a passive medium (watching a show) can make itself active and engaging. As an isekai, AoaB is special because it is written for moments of genuine discovery using two particular plot details. 

The first is that the characters around Main are not aware that she was isekai'd, so there is no convenient reason for someone to offer her a compedium of basic facts about the new fantasy world. Given that the audience's knowledge of the world closely follows Main's, we must learn alongside Main and experience the same restrictions as she does.

The second is clever. Main starts life in the new world in one of the most unpriviledged groups of her society: a child peasant in a bookless society. What little information the people around her can offer is mostly restricted to that of plebian life. It takes many episodes - and many years of Main's life - for the details of the greater societal structure to be revealed. Yet, it is never a complete picture. The world's magic gets a similar treatment, as it is deeply entangled with the hierarchies of the society. Despite Main's nontrivial relationship to magic, Main is never offered a straightforward explanation of the magical system: what does a peasant girl need to know about the complicated facets of the world?

The key choices made by the author of AoaB opens the door to genuine interaction and exploration of their world. I'll attempt to convey its impact on the story while avoiding spoilers.

 <p><img src="/assets/images/Main1.png" alt="Main" style="float: left; margin-right: 15px;">
 Shortly after Main is reincarnated, one of her first observations is NOT that she suddenly feels great power within, or that a video game UI has popped up in her vision. Rather, it is that her hair feels gross and she wants to put it up in a bun. To do this she first asks her sister, Tuuli, if she can break a leg off of her doll to use as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_stick">hair stick</a>. Protective of her toy, Tuuli offers to carve her one instead. When Main puts her hair up using the carved stick Tuuli scolds Main, reminding her that only adults are allowed to put their hair up. Main comprimises, holding up half of her hair with the sick and letting the rest lay free: a symbol of her status as a mix of adult and child.

Main's strong will and deep desire to understand how the world around her can faciliate her goals drives the cycle of "moments of discovery" throughout AoaB. The world feels open and alive as a result. However, we are still passive while watching. Main makes the choices, and ultimately we are along for the ride. What if we want to experience discovery first-hand by making our own observations, decisions, and risks? A common way to put oneself in these shoes is to pick up a video game, say a copy of...

Few details are revealed to the player aside from basic controls and mechanics. However, the game contains much more than the initally presented details. How one progresses and deals with the challenges ahead is left entirely up to the individual. This allows for many moments of discovery that are not explicitly scripted or planned by the developers, but are emergent from the unique circumstances of one's journey. 

## The value of witholding details
The way we interact with a lot of media, and frankly our lives overall, sometimes has _too_ much context. Fantasy stories lay out the detail and nuances of their worlds in neat and tidy packages, video games provide structured boundaries of play and expectations; in life, there are online guides for just about every activity one can conceive of, which leaves little for us to discover on our own. I often reflect on a cooking memory where I was preparing chicken to go along some fried rice. At the same time, I was snacking on a mandarin orange, so in a moment of raw inspiration I decided to squeeze some of the juices from my snack onto the chicken. This resulted in some sort of delicious sweet and spicy glaze, giving me the best tasting chicken I have ever prepared. What tasted better was that it was the result of pure curiosity. The decision to roll into a wall rather follow the beaten path, unlocked a secret room and sweet victory.

Later in life, I did some reading on cooking techniques (shout out to Salt Fat Acid Heat) where I learned about the value and utility of acids in the kitchen. This helped me understand why what I did turned out so good. Had I learned this information prior to that fateful home-cooked meal -- letting the book be the driver of my decisions rather than experimentation -- the moment would not be nearly as special, and likely not one remembered years later.

I often feel an inner desire to follow the footsteps of the experts. To catch up. To use the best possible information to do the thing in the best possible way. A video from 

## Counterpoint
Is my point that we should always pursue activities blindly, avoiding any helpful knowledge in case it spoils some personal moment of discovery? No. What I am hoping to convey is the value of balancing the use of information in our life's pursuits. This pertains to personal experience, the "right" balance will depend on the individual, so I won't try to make any value judgements on how to find that balance. Though, I will offer one last anecdote to exemplify a way I am trying to find this balance for myself.

The day before writing this sentence was Christmas '22. Romana gifted to me a 35mm film camera. Having never touched analogue photography (outside of some instant film LINK TO INSTANT FILM PICTURES HERE), I immediately started googling articles and books to help prepare me for this experience. This is where I have to stop and think. How many details do I really want to lay out for myself? Am I trying to become a professional photographer here? Do I wish to fit in with the NYC art student scene? No. I am here to have fun and try things. So let's pull a couple film books off of my reading list, and focus on what is going to best empower me to "have fun and try things." For me, it is little fun to blow a roll of film on over and under exposed shots. I'd at least like for my photos to _come out_.

My wife (Romana) and I got interested in AoaB after watching a [deep dive on isekai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6fghPHF3Zc) by YouTuber Noralities.

Outline:

Main point: genuione experiences of discovery make media good
hook: combining two really different looking pieces of media to catch attention
example 1: AoaB
    intentional choices about the plot set up the protagonist (by extension, viewer) for more moments of genuine discovery
    concrete example of this happening
    broader comments on how this makes things more enjoyable
example 2: DS
    little explanation and lack of traditional limitations allow the player to really invest in discovery
