Howdy! My name is Kirk Bonney: mathematician, software developer, data scientist, water researcher, and cat enthusiast. Welcome to my webpage where I try to occasionally capture some of the interesting things that pass through my brain. I also share some of my creative endeavors such as music and photography. Please enjoy poking around.
